## What are tags????
well according to google

"Tags" provide web browsers with instructions about the web page, such as where to display images, and how the document is structured. Tags are always enclosed in angle brackets: < >. Tags are comprised of elements and attributes.

``` html
<p> </p>

<img>
```
tags can either self close or require a seperate closing tag. the p or paragraph tag is an example of a tag that needs a seperate closing tag. While img or the image tag is a self closing tag.

## The Head
``` html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"/>
    <title> Your Title Here </title>
</head>
```
The head attaches a style file or a "style.css" file to your html document, which in this case is "index.html". You can also set the title of your website in the head.

## The Main Meal

``` html
<main>
    <header>
        <h1> Here is a header! </h1>
    </header>

    <body>
        <p> Here is a paragraph! </p>
    </body>

    <footer>
        <p> Here is your Fooooter! </p>
    </footer>
</main>
```
The code after is a simple piece of code that outlines the structure of your website. this will contain most of your content!
